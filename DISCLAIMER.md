# HGP — Disclaimer (Scope, Limits, Ethics)

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Project:** HGP Extreme Research v2.0 (SK/EN)

## What this project is
HGP is a **hypothetical / conceptual research & education website**. It explores **models, measurements, and simulations** around unusual energy-conversion ideas **as thought experiments**.

- The content is designed to be **transparent, reproducible, and falsifiable** (where possible).
- The `/sim/` folder contains **toy models** and **numerical experiments** that illustrate assumptions and sensitivities.

## What this project is NOT
- **Not a validated energy technology.**
- **Not a claim of “infinite/unlimited/free energy.”**
- **Not an investment pitch, fundraising vehicle, or a promise of commercial feasibility.**
- **Not a replacement for peer-reviewed physics or engineering practice.**

## Conservation-of-energy note (plain language)
Any usable energy conversion requires an **energy gradient** and a **work cycle** (e.g., water falls, heat flows, chemicals react).  
A static gravitational field **by itself** does not provide continuously extractable energy without an accompanying physical process.

## How to read the site responsibly
1. Treat every model as: **Assumptions → Equations → Outputs → Limits**.
2. If units or constraints are missing, consider it **incomplete** until clarified.
3. Prefer “can we test this?” over “does this sound impressive?”

## Ethics & safety
This project explicitly avoids encouraging deceptive claims. If you share or cite the work:
- keep the **hypothetical** framing intact,
- do not present it as a proven generator or perpetual-motion device.
