# For Educators (Physics / STEM / Critical Thinking)

HGP can be used as a classroom-ready case study: how to convert a speculative claim into a responsible educational project.

## Suggested lesson formats
### 1) 45–60 min: “Spot the flaw” workshop
- Students read the **Method & Limits** page.
- They apply the **Checklist** to a short claim (teacher-provided or from online sources).
- Deliverable: a 1-page critique with unit checks and an “energy source” explanation.

### 2) 90 min: Simulation as hypothesis test
- Students run one toy model from `/sim/`.
- They modify one parameter and write what changed and why.
- Deliverable: short lab note: assumptions → result → limitation.

### 3) Team project (1–2 weeks)
- Choose a viral “free energy” claim (video/blog).
- Apply the HGP methodology:
  1) define variables & units
  2) identify implied energy source
  3) show missing gradient / conservation issue
  4) propose a minimal test or simulation
- Deliverable: report + optional interactive chart (see Demo page).

## Why this works
- Students learn **scientific hygiene**, not just formulas.
- Emphasizes ethics: how to avoid misleading communication.

## Tips
- Keep tone curious, not mocking.
- Reward correct identification of assumptions and unit errors.
