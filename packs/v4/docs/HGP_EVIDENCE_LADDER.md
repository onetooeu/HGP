# HGP Evidence Ladder (E0–E5)

This ladder standardizes how strong a claim is allowed to be, based on what falsification gates it has survived.

| Level | Name | Requirements |
|---:|---|---|
| **E0** | Observation | unstructured observation only |
| **E1** | Instrument sanity | passed **G0** (calibration, saturation, complete metadata) |
| **E2** | Bias controlled | passed **G1** (blind/random toggles + null rig) |
| **E3** | Statistical signature | robust **K3** signature survives confound regression |
| **E4** | Physical coherence | **K4** spatial coherence *or* **K2** symmetry-surviving thrust |
| **E5** | Energy-consistent | **K1** net energy > 5σ + method parity + replication |

**Rule:** A claim must be presented with its level (e.g., “E3 candidate”), and cannot be rhetorically promoted beyond its level.
