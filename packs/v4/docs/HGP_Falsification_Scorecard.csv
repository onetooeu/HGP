Gate,Criterion,PassFail,EvidenceLink,Notes
G0,"Instrument sanity (calibration, saturation, metadata)",,,
G1,Null equivalence under blinding,,,
G2,Polarity flips + wiring/ground topology swaps do not explain effect,,,
G3,Environment confounds recorded + regressed (temp/humidity/EMI),,,
G4,"Independent replication (same protocol, comparable effect)",,,
G5,Optional: strict energy accounting excludes conventional sources,,,
B1,Bayes factor computed with declared priors; sensitivity analysis done,,,
B2,Model comparison favors anomaly model across reasonable priors,,,
R1,Full raw data + scripts archived immutably,,,
