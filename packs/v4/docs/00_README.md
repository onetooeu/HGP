# HGP Scientific Research Pack (v2)

This pack is a **falsification-first** scientific working set for the *Hypotetický Gravitovoltaický Panel (HGP)* concept.

**What it contains**
- A long-form PDF dossier (research style)
- Reproducible simulations, data (CSV/JSON), and generated figures
- Experimental methodology: preregistration templates, null tests, and confound control
- Glossary and notation
- Safety & ethics boundaries (no hazardous build instructions)

**What it intentionally does NOT contain**
- No step-by-step construction, wiring diagrams, or operational parameters for hazardous systems
  (high voltage, vacuum engineering, cryogenics, strong EM fields).

Use this pack to iterate on:
- theory statements that can be falsified,
- measurable signatures (noise, hysteresis, correlations),
- robust statistical analysis that resists self-deception.


## v4-mix upgrades (added)

The following documents extend the pack into a mixed-claim research autopilot (K1–K4):

- `HGP_SCORECARD_V4_MIX.md` — operational PASS/FAIL thresholds across K1–K4
- `HGP_AUTOPILOT_DECISION_TREE.md` — unified decision flow (what test follows what)
- `HGP_CONFOUND_ATLAS_V4_MIX.md` — confound fingerprints + kill-tests
- `HGP_PREREG_TEMPLATE.md` — pre-registration template (anti p-hacking)
- `HGP_EVIDENCE_LADDER.md` — E0–E5 evidence strength ladder
