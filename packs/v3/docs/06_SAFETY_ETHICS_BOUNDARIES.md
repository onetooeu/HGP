# Safety & Ethics Boundaries

This pack intentionally avoids operational construction guidance for hazardous systems:
- high voltage,
- vacuum engineering,
- cryogenics,
- strong EM fields.

## Why
Warnings do not neutralize risk. Actionable build steps can cause harm.

## Ethical publication rules
- Separate speculation from established science.
- Publish null results.
- Encourage independent replication.
- Avoid claims of unlimited energy.
- Provide confound-control and falsification criteria.
