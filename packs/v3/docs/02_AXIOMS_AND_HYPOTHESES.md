# Axioms & Hypothesis Space

## A1 — Gravity as optimization (core axiom)
Gravity is modeled as an **emergent optimization process** over informational state complexity.
Newton/Einstein remain effective approximations in the observed regime.

## A2 — Global cost functional (schematic)
Define an abstract functional:

C_total = C_energy + C_entropy + C_compute + C_instability

This is a modeling device to express "the substrate prefers cheaper states". It is not a confirmed physical law.

## A3 — Soft spots
The hypothesis expects the highest responsiveness where degrees-of-freedom are huge:
- vacuum-like fluctuations,
- structured asymmetries,
- boundary/information conditions.

## Hypothesis branches (H0–H4)
- H0: null (all signals are artifacts)
- H1: conventional harvesting (thermal gradients, corona, RF pickup, tribo...)
- H2: information-thermo coupling only (Landauer-like constraints)
- H3: structured anomaly-relaxation signatures survive robust null tests
- H4: maximally exotic substrate behavior (last)
