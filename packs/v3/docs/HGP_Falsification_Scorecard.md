# HGP Falsification Scorecard

Use this scorecard as an **evidence ledger**. A hypothesis cannot advance unless gates are passed with evidence.

Files:
- `HGP_Falsification_Scorecard.csv` (editable)
- Attach evidence links (plots, logs, raw-data hashes, lab notes)

Bayesian gates:
- **B1**: Bayes factor computed with declared priors and sensitivity analysis.
- **B2**: Model comparison favors the anomaly model across reasonable priors.

Rule:
> If you cannot write the evidence link, it is not passed.
