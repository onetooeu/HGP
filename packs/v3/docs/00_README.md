# HGP Scientific Research Pack (v2)

This pack is a **falsification-first** scientific working set for the *Hypotetický Gravitovoltaický Panel (HGP)* concept.

**What it contains**
- A long-form PDF dossier (research style)
- Reproducible simulations, data (CSV/JSON), and generated figures
- Experimental methodology: preregistration templates, null tests, and confound control
- Glossary and notation
- Safety & ethics boundaries (no hazardous build instructions)

**What it intentionally does NOT contain**
- No step-by-step construction, wiring diagrams, or operational parameters for hazardous systems
  (high voltage, vacuum engineering, cryogenics, strong EM fields).

Use this pack to iterate on:
- theory statements that can be falsified,
- measurable signatures (noise, hysteresis, correlations),
- robust statistical analysis that resists self-deception.
