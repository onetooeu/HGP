"""
HGP Simulation Sandbox — Toy Model

Assumption tested:
Optimization cost relaxation in hypothetical model space

Simplification:
Mathematical abstraction; no physical coupling

Limitation:
Outputs are model scores, not energy predictions

Note: This script tests logical/algorithmic consistency under explicit assumptions.
It does NOT validate physical reality or imply a working energy technology.
