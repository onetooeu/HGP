"""
HGP Simulation Sandbox — Toy Model

Assumption tested:
Annealing-style search over parameter space

Simplification:
Heuristic optimization; no physical constraints except stated

Limitation:
Finds minima of toy cost; not proof of feasibility

Note: This script tests logical/algorithmic consistency under explicit assumptions.
It does NOT validate physical reality or imply a working energy technology.
