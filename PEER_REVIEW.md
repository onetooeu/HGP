# External Validation & Peer Review (Documented Plan)

This project is **closed**. No new functionality is required.
This document records *how* external validation could be performed,
without making it a dependency for project completion.

## Purpose
To validate the **methodological correctness** (not the energy concept)
by requesting brief feedback from independent experts.

## Suggested reviewers
- PhD candidate or postdoc in physics / engineering
- University lecturer in physics, thermodynamics, or scientific methodology

## Material to review
- `ASSUMPTIONS.md`
- `pages/method.html`
- `CHECKLIST.md`

## Requested feedback (scope-limited)
- Is the *critical method* internally consistent?
- Are unit checks and conservation arguments correct?
- Is the educational framing responsible and non-misleading?

## How to record feedback
- Short written statement (1–3 paragraphs)
- Can be neutral or critical
- Stored verbatim in this file as a quotation with attribution

## Status
- **Optional**
- **Not required for project validity**
- Recorded here to prevent scope creep

HGP remains complete regardless of whether this step is ever executed.
