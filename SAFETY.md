# SAFETY / BEZPEČNOSŤ

This repository is a **science‑fiction / hypothetical research portal**.
It is **not** a set of instructions to build hazardous hardware.

## What we publish (allowed)
- Conceptual architecture (non‑operational)
- Falsification methodology and *null‑tests*
- Simulations / toy models
- Measurement hygiene: how to detect artifacts, drift, 1/f noise, bias

## What we intentionally do NOT publish
- Step‑by‑step build instructions for hazardous hardware
- Concrete parameters for high‑voltage, vacuum, cryogenic, or strong‑field setups
- Wiring diagrams, BOMs, spacing/insulation details, or procedures enabling replication

## Hazard categories
- High voltage / high electric fields (shock, burns, arcing, fire)
- Vacuum / pressure systems (implosion, debris)
- Cryogenics (frostbite, asphyxiation, brittle fracture)
- Strong EM fields / RF (implant interference, burns, EMC hazards)
- Chemicals / adhesives / insulators (toxic fumes, allergies, fire)

## Minimum safety rules
- If you are not trained: stay with simulations and safe low‑voltage experiments.
- Never work alone; use a buddy system and emergency plan.
- Use certified equipment, fusing, PPE, ventilation, grounding.
- Pre‑register stop‑conditions; do not rationalize away failures.

**Safety is not a disclaimer; it is a practice.**
