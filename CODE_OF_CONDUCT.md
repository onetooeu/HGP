# Code of Conduct

HGP is a learning project. We keep discussions respectful, curious, and evidence-based.

## We expect
- Kind, constructive communication
- Focus on ideas, not people
- Clear labeling of assumptions vs. evidence
- No harassment, no hate, no bullying

## We do not allow
- Fundraising scams, investment pitches
- Deceptive “free energy” promotion
- Personal attacks

If a conflict happens: pause, restate the claim, apply the checklist, propose a falsification test.
