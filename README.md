# HGP Extreme Research v2.0 (SK/EN) — 2026-01-09

**HGP** is a **hypothetical / conceptual research & education site**.  
It is **not** a validated energy technology and **not** a claim of “infinite energy”.

- SK site: `/`
- EN site: `/en/`
- shared assets: `/assets/`
- optional simulation scripts: `/sim/`

## Quick start (static)
Open `index.html` (or serve the folder with any static server).

## Method & limits
- SK: `pages/method.html`
- EN: `en/pages/method.html`

## Documentation (repo root)
- `DISCLAIMER.md` — scope, limits, ethics, conservation note
- `ASSUMPTIONS.md` — unit discipline, conservation checks, reproducibility bar
- `ROADMAP.md` — development plan
- `CHANGELOG.md` — notable changes

## Simulations
See `sim/README.md` for how to run the toy-model scripts.

## License
See `LICENSE`.


## 🎓 Educational Value

This repository is designed as an educational and methodological sandbox.
What you can learn here:
- Critical reading of technical documents
- Unit consistency and conservation checks
- Separation of assumptions, models, conclusions
- Ethical handling of hypothetical research
- Simulation as assumption testing, not proof


## 🔧 Tools
- Checklist: `CHECKLIST.md` (also on site: `pages/checklist.html`)
- Interactive demo: `pages/demo.html`
- For educators: `FOR_EDUCATORS.md`
- Speculative appendix (science‑fantasy, clearly labeled): `pages/speculative-log.html`


## 🗂️ Future direction
- *Museum of flawed concepts*: add more case studies (over‑unity, antigravity, etc.) with the same methodology.

## 🤝 Contributing
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md`.


## 📚 Meta & Closure

- Archived extension map (non-goals): `FUTURE_WORK.md`
- Forensic transparency note: `FORENSIC_APPENDIX.md`

## Olymp Polish
- Glossary, citations, accessibility, ethics
