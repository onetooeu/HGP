# Case Study Template — Museum of Flawed Concepts

## Claim (as presented)
- Short quote/summary of the claim

## What would need to be true?
- List the hidden assumptions

## Unit check
- Identify key equations and verify SI units

## Energy accounting
- Where does energy come from?
- What decreases when output increases?

## Gradient / displacement
- Where is the gradient? (height/temperature/pressure/chemical potential/etc.)

## Baseline expectation
- What does classical physics predict? (often 0)

## Minimal falsification test
- One simple experiment/simulation that could disprove the claim

## Common misconceptions
- List common errors (confusing power vs energy, mixing units, circular reasoning)

## Responsible framing
- Educational note: why this is a good teaching example
