# Glossary & Notation (HGP Pack)

This glossary unifies terms used across v2–v4 packs.

## Core entities
- **HGP**: Hypotetický Gravitovoltaický Panel — a theoretical interface concept.
- **Axioms (A1–A3)**: assumed modeling postulates defining the hypothetical world.
- **Hypotheses (H0–H4)**: ladder from null to exotic claims.
- **Falsification gates (G0–G5)**: staged criteria; a claim cannot advance without passing prior gates.

## Notation (informal)
- \(S\): entropy (thermodynamic or informational depending on context).
- \(S_{inf}\): informational entropy (Shannon-style).
- \(\Delta S_{inf}\): change in informational entropy between states.
- \(T\): absolute temperature.
- \(k_B\): Boltzmann constant.
- \(E_{min}\): minimum dissipation required for irreversible erasure (Landauer).
- \(C_{total}\): abstract 'existence cost functional' (schematic modeling device).
- \(J\): toy relaxation flux defined as \(J = -dC/dn\) for cycle index \(n\).
- **sched**: ON/OFF schedule variable (0/1), ideally blinded and randomized.

## Analysis concepts
- **PSD**: power spectral density; used to diagnose noise colors and resonances.
- **Allan deviation**: stability metric for drift/1/f dominated processes.
- **Permutation test**: label-shuffling nonparametric p-value.
- **Bayes factor (BF10)**: evidence ratio between two models (M1/M0).

## Safety boundary
This pack does NOT include actionable build instructions for hazardous systems.
