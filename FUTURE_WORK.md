# Future Work Map (Non-Goals)

This document records *potential* extensions that were consciously **not implemented**.
It exists to show deliberation and prevent future pressure to “keep adding features”.

## Level 1 — Credibility Extensions
- External methodological comments (see `PEER_REVIEW.md`)
- Full forensic transcription of the original “infinite energy” text

## Level 2 — Educational Deepening
- Interactive control-panel simulation with live rule indicators
- Gallery of false positives across domains

## Level 3 — Technical Sustainability
- CI/CD for syntax, HTML validity, and links
- Portable “Hypothesis Testing Kit” for educators

## Level 4 — Meta & Future
- Historical boom/bust timeline of energy claims
- AI “Devil’s Advocate” that generates flawed arguments

## Why these are non-goals
- Each item is a **project on its own**
- Diminishing returns beyond the current state
- Risk of diluting the core message: methodology over spectacle

## Final decision
These ideas are archived **as ideas**, not tasks.

HGP is complete.
