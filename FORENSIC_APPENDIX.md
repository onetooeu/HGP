# Forensic Appendix (Conceptual)

A theoretical extension would include a full, line-by-line
forensic analysis of the earliest HGP drafts that claimed
“infinite energy”.

## What it would contain
- Original text fragments (left column)
- Methodological analysis (right column):
  - unit violations
  - missing energy source
  - absent gradient
  - unjustified extrapolation

## Why it is not included
- Original drafts are intentionally not preserved here
- The educational goal is met without reprinting flawed claims
- Avoids accidental re-amplification of pseudoscientific text

## Educational note
The *existence* of this appendix demonstrates radical transparency
without requiring the artifacts themselves.

This is a design choice.
