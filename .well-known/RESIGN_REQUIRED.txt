RESIGN REQUIRED

This build changed signed assets (new ONETOO Suite pages, service registry, CSP updates).
You MUST re-generate and re-sign the sha256 manifest before deployment.

1) Re-generate sha256.json
   python tools/gen_sha256_json.py

2) Point minisign to your secret key (example on Windows Git Bash)
   export MINISIGN_SECRET="/c/Users/TV/.minisign-hgpedu/minisign.key"

3) Sign (creates .well-known/sha256.json.minisig)
   bash tools/sign_minisign.sh

4) Verify
   minisign -V -p .well-known/minisign.pub -m .well-known/sha256.json -x .well-known/sha256.json.minisig

If verification is OK, commit and push.
