# GitHub Discussions (optional)

If you want to turn HGP into a living educational community:

1. Enable **Discussions** in the GitHub repository settings.
2. Create starter threads:
   - "Analyze This: critique an over-unity claim"
   - "Q&A: unit checks and conservation"
   - "Ideas: improve the demo / checklist"
3. Link discussions from `pages/method.html` and `pages/checklist.html` (optional).

This repo remains valid as a static educational archive even without discussions.
