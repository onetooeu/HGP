# Hypothesis Checklist (HGP)

Use this checklist to evaluate *any* speculative technical claim or model.

## A) Energy & physics (must pass)
1. **Energy source stated?** What is the explicit source of energy?
2. **Gradient / displacement?** Where is the gradient (height, temperature, pressure, chemical potential)?
3. **Conservation of energy respected?** If output energy appears, what input decreases?
4. **Work definition clear?** Is there motion/displacement under force?
5. **Units consistent?** Do equations reduce to correct SI units (J, W, etc.)?
6. **Boundary conditions stated?** What is held constant? What changes?

## B) Model integrity (should pass)
7. **Variables defined?** Every symbol has meaning and units.
8. **Assumptions listed?** What is assumed true (and why)?
9. **Simplifications stated?** What is ignored and what errors that can introduce?
10. **Limitations honest?** Where does the model break?
11. **Reproducibility?** Can someone rerun calculations with the same inputs?

## C) Evidence & ethics (context)
12. **Evidence type declared?** Theory / simulation / measurement / peer review?
13. **Claims proportional?** Are conclusions limited to what evidence supports?
14. **No fundraising / investment framing?** Avoid misleading people.
15. **Safety & misuse considered?** Could this claim be used to deceive?

## Quick verdict
- ✅ **Educational / exploratory**: clear assumptions + honest limits + no exaggerated claims.
- ❌ **Red flag**: “infinite/over-unity” + vague sources + inconsistent units + no gradient.
